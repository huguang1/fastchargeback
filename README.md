# fastchargeback


•	Fast Charging Platform, also known as a fourth-party recharge platform, is configured with multiple commonly used 
third-party payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat, etc. in the backend. When users submit payment requests on the 
platform, the platform integrates user information and requests the third-party platform. Then, the third-party payment
methods are displayed on the platform, and the transaction is completed once the payment is successfully notified by the
third-party. The system is primarily built using the Tornado asynchronous framework, with simple rate limiting strategy
and IP blacklist using Redis to prevent attacks. Redis and MySQL are used for master-slave replication and read-write
separation, while Nginx is used for load balancing. Token is used to ensure API security, and Vue and Layui are used for
the frontend implementation.
•	The main purpose of this platform is to improve payment stability by configuring multiple third-party payment 
methods, and to save payment transaction fees by choosing the platform with the lowest exchange rate. This system 
ensures security, speed, and stability in payment processing.
